description: "An attacker managed to intrude our local network and send suspicious links to most of our employees. One of them clicked it and downloaded a suspicious file and even ran it.\nThe file happened to contain a malicious exe,this granted the attacker acces to out system.\n\nThe attacker only left a message in a file and made changes to ensure persistence.\n\nWe managed to get a hold of the attackers activities.\n\n__Author__: Aerys"
