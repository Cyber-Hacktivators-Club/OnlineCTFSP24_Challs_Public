    Who needs persistence when you have clueless employees. gaining access to the local network yet again.
    This time the attacker did more than just leave a message.
    When the employee clicked a link on what he thought was an Omnitrix giveaway site, he installed a harmless looking pdf file and opened it, granting the attacker acccess to the machine.
    A carefully placed script he ran allowed him to download malicious SUS files into the victim machine, allowing him to capture keystrokes and whatnot.
    Then he injected the malicious files into legitimate softwares compromising their use and ensure that they keep running.
    The Employee responsible was executed.
    Our Forensics team managed to stop the attack and gather information on the system but even they couldn't uncover the vastness of the damage done, maybe you can.
