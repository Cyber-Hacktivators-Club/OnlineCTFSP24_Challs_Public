I was working on a biology assignment. I can't solve it by myself. So I’m giving it to my biology friends to see if they can solve it. They are, after all, studying DNA and mRNA right now.


mRNA sequence: AUGCAAGGUCUCUUGACCCAGCUCACUCAUACUAUUUAG
Key: 6, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 4, 5, 6, 5, 9 

Solution Logic:
Remove the Start and Stop Codons
mRNA after removing AUG (Start) and UAG (Stop):
CAA GGU CUC UUG ACC CAG CUC ACU CAU ACU AUU

Translate Codons to Amino Acids
CAA	Glutamine (Gln)
GGU	Glycine (Gly)
CUC	Leucine (Leu)
UUG	Leucine (Leu)
ACC	Threonine (Thr)
CAG	Glutamine (Gln)
CUC	Leucine (Leu)
ACU	Threonine (Thr)
CAU	Histidine (His)
ACU	Threonine (Thr)
AUU	Isoleucine (Ile)

Use the Key to Extract Letters

6º letter of Glutamine = m
3º letter of Glycine = y
4º letter of Leucine = c
3º letter of Leucine = u
1º letter of Threonine = t
9º letter of Glutamine = e
4º letter of Leucine = c
5th letter of Threonine → o
6th letter of Histidine → d
5th letter of Threonine → o
9th letter of Isoleucine → n

Final Decoded Text:
